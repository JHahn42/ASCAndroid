Variables that may need to be adjusted can be changed from the Constants java class, and include things like, the servrer IP, 
mapbox api key, refresh rate of information from server, and the mapbox style used if it needs to be changed.

This Armchair Stormchasers app was created by the Development Team, Robert Gunderson, Jacob Hahn, William Moore and Ian Pemberton
